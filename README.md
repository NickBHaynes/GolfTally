# GolfTally
An IOS project, used to create an adaptable golf scoring app for friends to use and to keep track of the amount of shots each owes in stroke play, away from their handicaps.

Origionally created just to keep track between myself and one friend, this project is slowly being expanded to become a universal tally keeper, potentially with the scope to be used for more than just Stroke Play Golf.

The user can input their scores after each round (with each other) and the app will tell the user an updated shot number which the user "Owes" or "Is owed by" the other player. The amount of round which are used to calculate this number can be changed, with more user customizability planned.
